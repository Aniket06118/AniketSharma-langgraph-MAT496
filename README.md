**Lesson 1**
- A single language model has limited abilities since it lacks access to tools, external data, and complex workflows.
- To overcome this, many large language models use control flows made up of pre- and post-processing steps, forming what’s called a “chain.”
- The control flow of an agent is directed by an LLM, determining how it operates.
- A Router agent depends on an LLM to choose among predefined steps (less autonomy), while a Fully Autonomous agent independently plans and executes tasks (more autonomy).
- LangGraph helps maintain reliability even when giving the LLM more control, effectively “bending the reliability curve.
